# PCI DSS 11.6.1 – Client-Side Script Integrity Scanner

## Overview
This project is an educational client-side security prototype designed to demonstrate how unauthorized JavaScript execution and DOM manipulation risks can be detected in alignment with PCI DSS 4.0 Requirement 11.6.1.

The focus is on security visibility, detection logic, and structured reporting rather than open-source tooling.
